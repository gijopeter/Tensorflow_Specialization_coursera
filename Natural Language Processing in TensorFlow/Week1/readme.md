Neural networks requirs numerical data for processing and hence text data needs to be converted to corresponding numerical representation.
The first week discuss about Tokenization and padding of text sentences. Tokenization is the process of converting the text into numeric values, with a number representing a word or a character. 
Natural text data contains sentences of varying length but neural networks operates on fixed length dataset. Padding helps to convert numeric sequence(corresponds to text) to fixed length representation
