Repository conatins code files for Coursera Tensorflow specialization. 
It is highly recommended to have good theorectical understanding of various kinds Neural network architectures(Feed forward, CNN, RNN) before proceeding with specialization. 
Following deeplearning specialization from deeplearning.ai by Andre Ng is highly recommended prior to Tesnorflow specialization.
