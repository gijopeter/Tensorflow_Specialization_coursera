[TesnorFlow specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice#courses)

Repository conatins code files for Coursera Tensorflow specialization. 
It is highly recommended to have good theorectical understanding of various kinds Neural network architectures(Feed forward, CNN, RNN) before proceeding with specialization. 
[Deep leaning specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?#courses) from deeplearning.ai by Andrew Ng is highly recommended prior attending Tensorflow specialization.
